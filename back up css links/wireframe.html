    <p>Our scientists are dedicated to developing world-class viral solutions for government and military applications. Howard Pier has unveiled a new compound developed here at the CDC laboratory in Dayton, Ohio. The development of this viral strain was a direct result of adding T-hylioxa with C1h water fluid. The compound name is Y-Histvua. This isolated compound has many different medical and military uses. The primary use of this compound is to stimulate cellular regrowth of damaged tissues and muscles. The compound is also used for crop fertilizer. The research to market the compound has been funded by the Department of Defense under contract (Visba) 10 Section 47-100.</p>
